# Hi, I’m @Noahbryson
- I am a Biomedical Engineer working in Medical Devices and Neuroscience Research. 
- I’m interested in all things Neuroscience, Electrical Engineering, Data Science and how these topics can intersect.
- I’m currently learning C++ for embedded systems
- I’m not currently looking to collaborate on much as I am swamped with work and research
- You can reach me at nbryson@mddriven.com for business/research inquiries and nbryson2000@gmail.com for connections and fun stuff
